# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We need to pull data from these months and provide our results to W. Avy.

## Results
### Key Differences between June and December

1. Temperatures in June (on average) appear to be about 5 degrees higher. This is not that big of a difference for polar opposite times of the year. This is good news for W. Avy, providing support for creating his surf shop.
2. The spread of the data for June is 21 degrees, and the spread for December is 27 degrees. While this does show some variability, the IQR for  June is 4 degrees and the IQR for December is 5 degrees. This baccks the point that the weather really is not that variable. Constant temperatures provide further reasoning for W. Avy to open his surf shop.
3. The last main differnce would be the minimum temperatures. People want to go out to the surf shop on hot days. The lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees, and the lowest temperature in December was 56 degrees. While people may not want to go when it is 56 degrees out, these data points do not appear to be the normal. This should not be too much of a worry. 


## Summary
These results further provide support for W. Avy opening his surf shop. All 3 key differences, as seen above, are not that crucial of a difference. I would suggest doing a few more queries to make sure the shop will do well. The first query I would recommend would be the hours of sunlight in December and June. People (most of the time) attend the beach while the sun is out. Knowing the hours people will be at the beach is crucial. The second query I would recommend would be what the temperature actually feels like. Sea breezes from the ocean often produce winds that make it feel colder than it actually is. By looking at what it actually feels like (accounting for wind and potential humidity), we can more accurately look at what beachgoers experience in terms of weather.
